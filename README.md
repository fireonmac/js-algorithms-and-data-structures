## Big-O Notation

### What is good Code?

1. Readable
2. Scalable (Big O)

### Way to measure efficiency of code

How long an algorithm takes to run when it comes to scale, regardless of our computer differences.

### Space Complexity

- Refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm including the space of input values for execution.
- Auxiliary space is simply extra or temporary space.
- Auxiliary space + space used by input values
- Constant value is O(1) - number, boolean, null …
the other values are O(n) - string, object, array …

## Problem Solving Patterns

### Frequency Counter Pattern

- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings

### Multiple Pointers Pattern
- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## Data Structures

### What is a Data Structure?

- A data structure is a collection of values. Algorithms are the steps or processes we put into place to manipulate theses collection of values.
- The values can have relationships among them and they can have functions apply to them.
